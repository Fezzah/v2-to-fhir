Need a gForge (#20522 - https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&tracker_item_id=20467&start=0) to identifier data type to add the value set subset from HL7 0301 OR clarification on how to populate ...system when it is a DNS (or other relevant ""types""), e.g., point to another RFC that defines domain names. And get better clarification between type and system.

Note that in messages that include the CLIA# for labs here would fall in the right place here.  However, in non-messages the CLIA # would not be in MessageHeader, but elsewhere.  That needs to be clarified first elsewhere before we can determine what additional guidance to provide."
