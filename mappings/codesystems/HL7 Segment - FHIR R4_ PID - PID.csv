While it seems that ""primary"" would mean ""true"", it is unclear how this would be resolved if from other sources another language is marked as ""true"".  If not marked, it would not be clear which language to put in on the return.  Furthermore, depending on purpose, the language may change (verbal vs. written, etc.)  So not having cardinality and purpose aligned makes it hard to have a consistent, correct map.  Consequently if set to t""true"" some are concerned it may expected to be used for, or not be used for translation purposes it is or is not intended for that purpose.  Therefore, should we or should we not leave this mapping in?"
