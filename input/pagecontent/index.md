The HL7 V2 to FHIR Implementation Guide supports the mapping of HL7 Version 2 messages
segments, datatypes and vocabulary to HL7 FHIR Release 4.0 Bundles, Resources, Data
Types and Coding Systems.

This implementation guide provides the Concept Maps and references to the Spreadsheets
used to generate them, as well as additional information and material to support validation
and testing of implementations.

This guide is organized into three main sections:

1. [Introduction](introduction.html)
   This section provides an overview of the project, and explains how mapping is performed.
2. [Mappings](mappingoutputs.html)
   This section provides an index to the mappings produced by this project, organized
   by message, segment, datatype, or vocabulary mapping.
3. [Implementation and Use]()
   This section covers implementation considerations and validation, and provides
   example test conversions.
