<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The mappings for this round of review are documented and published using a spreadsheet style format.  This format allows for easy, side-by-side editing and review of from=to mappings with supporting information.  At the same time, the content must be computable enabling a mapping engine to ingest the mappings to populate their base mappings for subsequent refinement.</p>

<p>To this end, the infrastructure is based on a number of FHIR ConceptMap profiles to capture the relevant data for message structure, segment, data type, and vocabulary mappings.  Until such time that tools are available to directly edit the ConceptMaps, Google Spreadsheets are used to capture the mappings and populate the ConceptMaps in gitHub at regular intervals.  Regardless of the tools used, as the displayed format will be spreadsheet style, we refer to the mappings as mapping spreadsheets.</p>

<p>The following provides a review for each of the types of spreadsheets the mapping and supporting information capture.</p>

<h2 id="mapping-spreadsheets">Mapping Spreadsheets</h2>

<h3 id="general-formatapproach">General Format/Approach</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Regardless of the mapping spreadsheet, the spreadsheet is organized into three sections:
    <ul>
      <li>HL7 v2
        <ul>
          <li>The v2 elements being mapped.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Conditions
        <ul>
          <li>The condition(s), if any, that determine whether the v2 element is mapped
            <ul>
              <li>If there is no condition, the mapping must always be applied</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>HL7 FHIR
        <ul>
          <li>The FHIR element that the v2 element is mapped to.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Rows are listed in sequence of how they appear in the v2 standard.
    <ul>
      <li>The first column, Sort Order, provides a sort order that can re-create the original v2 standard sequence in case one opts to re-sort/filter the rows.</li>
      <li>In general, the content in the spreadsheet is declarative, not procedural but when implementing a tool to perform transformations, implementers must consider that in some cases relationships do exist between constructed FHIR resources
        <ul>
          <li>For example, for messages, there may be dependencies between segments
            <ul>
              <li>For example, the PID segment will create a Patient resource which is then added to with the content of the PD1 segment and referenced by the Encounter resource</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>One v2 element will have one or more rows as multiple or different FHIR elements need to be populated.
    <ul>
      <li>Each row is executable on its own, whether it involves a different or the same v2 element.</li>
      <li>When a single v2 element has multiple rows, the order of execution of the rows for that element should not be important</li>
      <li>The sort order number will repeat when the v2 component is repeated to this end.  For example, if ORC-2 Placer Order Number maps to two different FHIR elements, then both rows would have the same sort order number “2”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A condition includes the following statements:
    <ul>
      <li>If computable, both a condition using:
        <ul>
          <li>the following easy to read syntax (referenced as Computable ANTLR - further documented here: <a href="antlrconditionsyntax.md">ANTLR Condition Syntax</a>)
            <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   IF X EQUALS "A"
   IF X NOT EQUALS
   IF X VALUED
   IF X NOT VALUED
   IF IN ("A","B", "C")
   IF NOT IN ("A","B", "C")
   IF X expression OR Y expression
   IF NOT (X expression OR Y expression)
   IF NOT (X expression AND Y expression)
   IF X expression AND Y expression
   IF ((X expression AND Y expression) OR C expression)
   IF X LST.COUNT EQUALS  ***LST.COUNT is the count of entries in the list at hand
   IF X LST.COUNT NOT EQUALS
   IF X LST.COUNT GREATER THAN
   IF X LST.COUNT LESS THAN
   IF X LST.COUNT GREATER THAN OR EQUALS
   IF X LST.COUNT LESS THAN OR EQUALS
</code></pre></div>            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The FHIRpath syntax (referenced as Computable FHIRpath) https://www.hl7.org/fhir/fhirpath.html)</li>
      <li>If not computable or in addition to the computable condition further non-computable conditions must be considered as well (referenced as Narrative).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>[n] Notation
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple v2 components may need to update the same instance of a FHIR element, or should yield a new instance of the same FHIR element.  To distinguish whether the mappings are to the same or different FHIR element instance each FHIR element at the appropriate place in the path will use the [n] notation.  Those FHIR elements with the same value in the same place in the path should apply the mapping to the same instance of that element.</li>
      <li>Example: PID-13 Phone Number - Home and PID-14 Phone Number - Business are both mapped to Patient.telecom.  However, they need to yield different instances.  Thus, PID-13 maps to Patient.telecom[1] and PID-14 to Patient.telecom[2].</li>
      <li>Note that this does not mean that there is a first and second slot where one is kept empty if not available in v2.  Rather it just means they are to be different if both present.</li>
      <li>If the mapping needs to yield multiple instances and the v2 value needs to be applied to multiple FHIR element instances, [each] is used.</li>
      <li>Example:  OBX-2 Observation Identifier needs to be mapped to all Observation.component.code instances if OBX-5 Value contains multiple values.  The FHIR attribute being mapped to then states Observation.component[each].code.</li>
      <li>While typically these notations are a suffix on the FHIR element it applies to, in Data Type mappings you may see these as seemingly a prefix.  This would effectively apply to the FHIR element (typically an attribute) where that FHIR data type is actually referenced.</li>
      <li>Example: [1].Contactpoint.value and [2].ContactPoint.value mapped to from the v2 XTN data type would reflect the first instance of the attribute repetition is actually used, e.g., Patient.telecom that can repeat and is mapped to from PID-13 and PID-14 which have the v2 XTN data type.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Each mapping row includes comments to document any considerations for the mapping that can aid in further refining the mappings for local use.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="message-spreadsheet">Message Spreadsheet</h3>

<ul>
  <li>HL7 v2
    <ul>
      <li>Sort Order
        <ul>
          <li>See above</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Identifier
        <ul>
          <li>Contains an xml/json like path using the HL7 v2 XML approach of [MessageStructure].[GroupName or CHOICE].[SegmentName] where there may be multiple Group Names in play.</li>
          <li>When there is a segment in multiple places in the message structure where this path would yield the same string even though it involves different uses of the same segment, thus potentially different mappings, the main segment preceding the segment at hand will be included in front of that segment using a “:follow:” tag.
            <ul>
              <li>For example, the ARV segment is used after the PID and the PV1 in the ADT_A01 structure.  There may be in either case other segments between the PID (or PV1) and the ARV.  The identifier in both cases would be ADT_A01.ARV.  To distinguish the two uses and likely mappings of ARV, the identifier will be ADT_A01:follow:PID.ARV for the ARV effectively related to the PID and ADT_A01:follow:PV1.ARV for the ARV effectively related to the PV1.</li>
              <li>The primary segment it is related to will be used rather than any segments that may still be listed be between them (e.g., PD1) as they may not be present.</li>

      <li>Segment Map
        <ul>
          <li>The URL to the Segment Map that is to be used for the segment in this message structure in this location.</li>
          <li>There may be multiple flavors of the segment maps to support different mappings.  The flavor is appended to the end of the segment name using [] brackets, e.g., MSH[Provenance - Originator].</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>References
        <ul>
          <li>Defines for the Primary Target resource which resource.id it needs to reference.</li>
          <li>Used to establish attributes involved in referencing the row at hand and a resource created/updated elsewhere in the message when converting the v2 message to a bundle of FHIR resources.</li>

<p>When mapping from HL7 v2 messages to FHIR Resources, there are a number of cases where concept mapping needs to be performed.  When this mapping is performed, there may be information that is lost because it cannot be represented in a required coding system, or more specific detail may be lost when one or more codes is mapped to a singular required or preferred code in the FHIR specified terminology.</p>
